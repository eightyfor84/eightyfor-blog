## About Chronicle

Chronicle is a **local-first, git-backed Jamstack blogging platform**. It's built on the belief that your content should live on your terms — as plain files, in your control, forever.

### Philosophy

Most blogging platforms ask you to trade convenience for ownership:

- SaaS platforms own your data and can disappear overnight
- Traditional CMSes need servers, databases, and constant maintenance
- Static site generators give you control but lack a writing experience

Chronicle takes a different path. **Your content is a Git repository.** The CMS is an app that edits files directly on your disk. No API, no database, no lock-in.
